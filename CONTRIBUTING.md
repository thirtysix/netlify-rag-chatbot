## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create an issue with:

- **Clear title** describing the issue
- **Detailed description** of the problem
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Environment details** (Node version, OS, etc.)
- **Screenshots** if applicable

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please create an issue with:

- **Clear description** of the feature
- **Use case** - why is this feature needed?
- **Proposed implementation** (if you have ideas)
- **Alternatives considered**

### Submitting Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Test your changes thoroughly
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Submit a pull request

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run netlify:dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test the production build
npm run preview
```

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] The project builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All existing functionality still works
- [ ] New features are working as expected
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Environment variables are properly documented

### Database Changes

If your contribution involves database schema changes:

1. Update the appropriate schema files in `src/lib/db/`
2. Create migration scripts if needed
3. Document the changes in your PR
4. Test with both fresh databases and migrations

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings (except JSON)
- **Semicolons**: Use them
- **Line length**: Aim for 100 characters max
- **Naming conventions**:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for types and classes
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants

### File Organization

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into separate modules
- Group related functionality together
- Add comments for complex logic

### Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves embeddings from the database using hybrid search
 * @param query - The search query text
 * @param ragId - The RAG database identifier
 * @param options - Search configuration options
 * @returns Array of matching embeddings with scores
 */
async function searchEmbeddings(
  query: string,
  ragId: string,
  options: SearchOptions
): Promise<Embedding[]> {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Commit Messages
